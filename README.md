# XOR-gate-neural-network
Remake of my initial C++ implementation of a neural network training to learn a XOR gate using the Metropolis algorithm

# Getting Started
The project is a console application. The code is made using a Visual Studio 2022 solution (`xor-neural-net.sln`).
1. Open up the project in VS
2. To run the program use: `Ctrl + F5` or `Debug > Start Without Debugging menu`

This will build and run the project, after which you should be presented with a console window.
